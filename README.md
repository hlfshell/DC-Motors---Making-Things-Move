# DC-Motors---Making-Things-Move
I was asked to give a talk at [TechShop STL](http://techshop.ws/stl.html) on DC motors.

The document within was created in Google Docs, saved to pptx for sharing and storage.

The presentation, on its own, requires me - I tend to do picture/demo heavy presentations that I memorize prior. I have no notes unfortunately - it's just my style. BUT - some might find it useful to reference this.
